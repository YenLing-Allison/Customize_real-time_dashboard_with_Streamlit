# Dashboard
Dashboard overview: 
1. Goal: 
- Businesses: monitor and control inventory on a real-time basis
- High-level manager: Efficiently decision-making
- Employees collaboration: various store/departments in the company can work together to align their goals
2. Functions:
Filter by week and store: allow manager to have a quick overview of inventory and provide convenience to each store manager to evaluate the real-time situation
Performance and matric(for example): 
- Inventory value by Product: find out the value of unsold inventory stock in the latest week, seeing how much product value stores have
- Inventory turnover rate over week: by filtering brand, we calculate inventory turnover ratio to see how many times the inventory is sold over a given period
